<h1> CV Application </h1>

<h2>Brief Introduction </h2>
    Small CV application builder that takes in data in form fields as inputs and generates a CV application with that data.

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
    Skills that I will build upon completion of this project are some foundational skills in using ReactJS.  Practicing using class components and passing props between parent and child components as well as using listeners and a form to complete the application.  This will help me get familiar with reading ReactJS applications written primarily with class based components.
