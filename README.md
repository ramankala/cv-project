<h1> CV Application </h1>

<h2>Brief Introduction </h2>
    Small CV application builder that takes in data in form fields as inputs and generates a CV application with that data.

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
    Skills that I will build upon completion of this project are some foundational skills in using ReactJS.  Practicing using class components and passing props between parent and child components as well as using listeners and a form to complete the application.  This will help me get familiar with reading ReactJS applications written primarily with class based components.

<h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
    Learning to use ReactJS and applying the basics, mainly the two pillars being states and props to a project was a little challenging.  It was easy to grasp once I started playing around with it more, and I feel pretty confident in using States and Props for building projects using ReactJs.
